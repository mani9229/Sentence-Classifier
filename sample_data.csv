"While lifting weights on Friday and doing bent over rows, I felt a sharp pain in my lower back.  Some would say I threw it out and I had this happen one other time about 6 months ago.  Dropped to my knees and was sore for the rest of the day.  Overnight, it just became terrible.  Every time my body wanted to move, I woke everybody in the room up with moans of pain (wife, dog, cats)."
Something's watching me
